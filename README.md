# Corewar

This was my final project.
Corewar is a game where you make a champion in pseudo assembly and then let them fight memory.

Type make in the root of the folder to get your executables.

For an amazing explanation I will link you to a fellow student [@k-off](https://github.com/k-off/Corewar/wiki).
